# React TypeScript Minimal + Jest 🚀

The "React TypeScript Minimal + Jest" project is a minimal React application configured with TypeScript, Esbuild for compilation, and Jest for testing. It provides a simple and ready-to-use structure, enabling efficient development of React applications and testing using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Prerequisites 🛠️

Make sure to have Node 18 installed on your machine.

## Installation 🚚

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/saulocastillos/react-typescript-minimal`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-typescript-minimal`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## How to Use 🚀

To start the development server with live reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and see the application in action. Live reload ensures that code changes are automatically reflected in the browser.

## Project Structure 🏗️

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `entry-point.tsx`: Entry point of the application.
- `index.html`: Main HTML page of the project.
- `jest.config.js`: Jest configurations for testing.
- `src`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `app.tsx`: Main component of the application.
  - `app.spec.tsx`: Tests for the `App` component.
- `package.json`: Project configuration file.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configurations for the project.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
